# üçæ jingo

`jingo` is a [Jinja2](jinja-docs) string interpolation library for Go. This allows Go-project owners some flexability in their templating and string interpolation, especially if they themselves or other contributors come from a Python background. It attempts to duplication as much of the functionality and configuration of the original library.

**This project is in a VERY infant stage right now. I, Dan, would like to set up the internals before accepting major contributions, so please check back if you are interested in using jingo.**
